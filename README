# OVERVIEW #
gb is a library for Groebner basis computations. It relies on fast specialized linear algebra and thus depends on gbla

# FAST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS #
Using autotools one can compile and install gb by

* ./autogen.sh
* ./configure
* make
* make install

gb depends on the package gbla. Please make sure that gb's configure can find
the correct place with the pkg config info for gbla. If there are problems, you
can export this pkg config info path via
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:<your-directory>
For further installation instructions please see INSTALL.

# INSTALL ON MAC #
Use clang-omp for openmp support:
* ./autogen.sh
* ./configure CC=clang-omp
* make
* make install

# DEBUGGING #
In order to debug gb one needs configure with --enable-debug and use

```
libtool e gdb --args ./gb --options
```

since we build the library using libtool and link it then against the binary gb.


The input files need to have the following format at the moment:
First line: comma-separated list of variables, e.g. x1,x2,x3
Second line: modulus of the field, e.g. 32003
Following lines: in each line one polynomial, no shorthand notation, i,e,
between each coefficient and each power of a variable there is a "*" and for
each power of a variable there is "^" (whereas you can write "x1" instead of
"x1^1").

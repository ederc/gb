# OVERVIEW #
gbla is a library for reducing matrices coming from Groebner basis computations.
Its core functionality is the special Gaussian Elimination of
structured hybrid sparse-dense matrices due to Faug√®re and Lachartre.

# FAST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS #
Using autotools one can compile and install gbla by

* ./autogen.sh
* ./configure
* make
* make install

For further installation instructions please see INSTALL.

# INSTALL ON MAC #
Use clang-omp for openmp support:
* ./autogen.sh
* ./configure CC=clang-omp
* make
* make install

# DEBUGGING #
In order to debug gbla one needs configure with --enable-debug and use

```
libtool e gdb --args ./gbla --options
```

since we build the library using libtool and link it than against the binary gbla.

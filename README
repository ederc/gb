# OVERVIEW #
gb is a library for Groebner basis computations. At the moment only Faugere's
F4 Algorithm is available for computations over finite fields and the rationals.

# FAST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS #
Using autotools one can compile and install gb by

* ./autogen.sh
* ./configure
* make
* make install

# INTERFACES #
The package GB.jl at https://github.com/ederc/GB.jl provides a julia interface
for calling gb. If you want to write your own interface to gb you can use GB.jl
as a blueprint.
